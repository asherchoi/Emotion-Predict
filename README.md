## A Convolutional Neural Network Model for Real-time Facial Expression Recognition
A convolutional neural network model for live facial expression recognition using traditional webcams is proposed so as to support up to 30 fps video sequence. Since we encounter a variety of noisy perceptible environments due the fact of distortion of facial images according to shooting angle and challenges associated with varying illumination conditions, suitable image pre-processing techniques are experimented and applied. To guarantee real-time prediction of video sequence, considering the trade-off between accuracy and processing time, different model structures and their hyper-parameters are employed and tested. Our experiments on the selected model show 95% accuracy for distorted images and the average recognition delay at 0.03sec per image.
